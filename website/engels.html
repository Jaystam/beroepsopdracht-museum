            A garage box in The Hague is the place where the adventure started in 2008,
            with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles.
            The garage quickly became too small, after which they moved to a warehouse on an industrial estate.
            Unfortunately, the shed was not heated and everything had to be transferred to an empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter.
            When this building also had to be cleared out, the then collection of 10 arcade video games was stored with some spare parts in an old showroom for classic cars.
            Because there was no room to renovate or play with the cabinets, suitable space was looked for.
            It was found in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in Zoetermeer.
            There Hasan decided to rent the location with 4 friends and the adventure could grow into their own meeting place to practice their hobby and relax with a game.

                I was amazed, what a super nice museum.
                Great to be able to get started with these games.
                It was like going to an arcade in the old days without all those guilders and we're not even talking about the retro game consoles that are there in abundance.
                I hope we get to see a lot more.

                Been with 4 boys (10 to 12 years). We all enjoyed.
                Fun games and a lot of nostalgia (at least for me).
                We will definitely go again, only from Groningen it is a bit of a drive,
                but well worth it.

                A place where you can go back in time, from Atari to PlayStation.
                There is plenty to do here for young and old.
                The arcade cabinets also ensure that you race in a podracer or play Tekken against people.
                Take a look here and be overwhelmed by the game world.
